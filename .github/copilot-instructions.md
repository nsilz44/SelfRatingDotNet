This project is a MVC Server app for tracking skill progress. Prioritize C# and Blazor best practices. When generating code, prefer component-based design and separation of concerns. All skills should be rateable from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.1 and organized by categories.

When generating shell commands, use PowerShell syntax and conventions.
